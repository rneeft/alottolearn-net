My name is Rick Neeft. I'm a software developer. I'm working from The Netherlands for [VECOZO](https://www.vecozo.nl), a Dutch software company creating amazing software for the Dutch Healthcare sector. This blog, its contents and opinions are my own and does not reflect the opinions of my employer. I like to write about daily challenges at my work in the .NET and Microsoft space.
